09/18 I'm Gonna start logging all the improvmmennts and what changes I am making and why
Start develoment again and the model still is not grabbing on to training. 
I have tried a number of different solutions however none have worked. A CONV network I found on medium and regular dense layers have yet to identify how to avoid previously shot at moves.
I have also tracked down a number of memory and worked on speeding up the root of the enviroment.

Going to start today by adding on fit and a way to record memories will lean toward overfitting during these first few attempts at aquiring data.
Added the functionality to get a dataset from the games that were played. However the model seems to not even be training itself and predicts the same value no matter what. Sigmoids are same for all but last.

Created a new file for training off of previously recorded memories.
Great reduction in loss.
Added a custom accuracy function which confirms findings of a positive response to binary crossentropy loss with dense network.
Ultimately realized that above findings were due to a very small sample size allowing for over fitting.
Reshaped the model to add residual that come back in at the very end. Should have increased game length but did not.
Apples createml results in 96% accuracy for training data and used a boosted tree network. 
I am going to look into implementing something like this in tensorflow.

09/20 Implementing keras tuner to see if I can find better results on current training data.
